You can absolutely use custom JavaScript on top of Bootstrap's default scripts.

You'll want to keep your custom script(s) in a separate file to Bootstrap's JavaScript, remembering that external files are loaded from top-to-bottom, and that you'll need to load jQuery before loading Bootstrap's JavaScript.

Simply include your own JavaScript files after you load Bootstrap's JavaScript file to have your changes override those introduced by Bootstrap:

<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/popper.js/1.12.3/umd/popper.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
<script src="custom_script_1.js"></script>
<script src="custom_script_2.js"></script>
